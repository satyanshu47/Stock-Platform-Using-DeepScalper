# Stock Predictor using EIEE 🚀
### Created by [Om Thakur](https://github.com/SuperPowered-Cat/), [Kumar Satyanshu](https://github.com/satyanshu47), [Meghansh Govil](https://github.com/MeghanshGovil) and [Divyansh Gupta](https://github.com/D-Expynos) using [TradeMaster](https://github.com/TradeMaster-NTU/TradeMaster/tree/1.0.0).
This repository is a stock market prediction project using **DeepScalper**, a risk-aware deep reinforcement learning model. The project will:
- Fetch and process **stock market data** (Yahoo Finance).
- Compute **technical indicators** using **TA-Lib**.
- Train a **DeepScalper**-based reinforcement learning model.
- Visualize and analyze stock trends.

## 📜 Reference Paper
This project is inspired by:  
🔗 **DeepScalper: A Risk-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for Stock Trading**
